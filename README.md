COMP 530 - Homework 1


This C program reads in lines of characters from standard input (i.e., the keyboard) and writes them as 80 character lines to standard output (i.e., the “screen”) with the following changes:

* Every carriage return (newline) is replaced by a space, and 
* Every adjacent pair of asterisks “**” is replaced by a “^”.
* If the length of a line happens to be less than 80 characters (only happens on the last line), the line is not written.
